# Our Vision

At YouBet, our vision is simple yet profound: **to make every effort worth it**. We aim to create a system where every contribution, no matter how small, is recognized and rewarded fairly. This goes beyond just betting; we envision a world where a GitHub commit, a valuable document, and any other form of effort can be recorded and valued appropriately.

- Step 1: Building the Infrastructure
- Step 2: Fair Evaluation of Digital Contributions
- Step 3: Bridging the Digital and Real Worlds
